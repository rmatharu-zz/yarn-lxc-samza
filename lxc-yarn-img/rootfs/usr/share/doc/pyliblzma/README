I initially wrote this python module was initially written by as a project
assignment in the course "INF5660 - Advanced problem solving with high level
languages" at the University of Oslo, May 2008. It was written as a first
attempt of both writing a proper python module and also as first proper project
written in the C language, so any obscurities or just plain retardness is
expected, and any help at correcting such will be greatfully accepted. :)
