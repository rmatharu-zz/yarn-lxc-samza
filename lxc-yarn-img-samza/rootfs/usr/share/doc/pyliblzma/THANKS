Thanks
------

This module would be a whole lot harder to write if it weren't for help and
inspiration by others. So I'd like to thank the following people:
* Lasse Collin, the author of lzma utils and liblzma, providing me with a lot
  of help, understanding and insight on LZMA.
* Gustavo Niemeyer, for help and advice on C/Python and also benefitting a lot
  from his python bz2 module which helped me out a lot as a reference.
* Whoever wrote the python zlib module which also helped as a reference.
* Joachim Bauch, author of pylzma (different format, different language),
  for much the same as well his his regression tests that I based some of mine
  on.

Thx!
