pyxattr
=======

This is the pyxattr module, a Python extension module which gives access
to the extended attributes for filesystem objects available in some
operating systems.

Downloads: go to http://pyxattr.k1024.org/downloads/. Latest
version is 0.5.3. The source repository is either at
http://git.k1024.org/pyxattr.git or at
https://github.com/iustin/pyxattr.

Requirements
------------

pyxattr has been written and tested on Linux, kernel v2.4 or later, with
XFS filesystems; ext2/ext3 should work also. If any other platform
implements the same behavior, pyxattr could be used.

You need to have the attr library (including development headers; most
distributions should have this, under various names) and setuptools
installed in order to build and install the module.

hence the change to LGPL 2.1), and even older versions were licensed under GPL
